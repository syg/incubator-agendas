## Agenda items

### Decimal

- Quick overview of proposal, use cases, and design
  space. (Possibly skip, depending on knowledge of
  attendees.)
- Adding Decimal128 to a JS engine: add a third-party C/C++
  library or handmade implementation?
- Should it be possible to specify precision in any
  operation (perhaps even including instantiation)? Or
  should precision be accomplished after the fact with
  round/truncate operations?
