## Agenda items

A call focusing on the [Intl.MessageFormat proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-messageformat),
and issues raised during the Tokyo TC39 meeting.

### Intl.MessageFormat

- **Error handling**: The current proposed API warns rather than throws on error,
  and provides a formatter method callback argument for customizing the behaviour.
  Is there an alternative that should be considered for this?

- **MessageFunction API**: MF2 allows for user-definable functions that are available during formatting.
  As the results of these functions may be used in multiple different ways,
  the user-facing API for implementing this is a bit complex.
  Could it be simplified?
