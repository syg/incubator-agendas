- **Call** TBD

## Agenda items

A call focusing on the [Stable Formatting proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-stable-formatting/).

### Stable Formatting

The proposal currently presents two alternative paths for its progress:

1. Add support for a new "null" locale to ECMA-402 Intl formatters and functions.
   This would be a general solution to the problems presented in the proposal,
   but it would extend the scope of Intl to cover some non-localization use cases.

2. Add new options and methods to ECMA-262 functions and objects.
   This approach would be more surgical,
   identifying specific cases where functionality should be added to the language

We need to discuss which approach to take,
and what each of the approaches would look like in more detail.
